<h3> A little about me...</h3>
<p> My name is <b> Jenny Ackerman. </b> This is my third year at Winona State University and I am a <i> Data Science Major </i> with a minor in <i> Statistics. </i> I don't know yet what I would like to do with this major, <b> <font size = "5"> yet.
</font> </b> <br/> <font color = "green" >I'm from Brooklyn Park, MN, </font> and went to <font color = "orange" > Osseo Senior High </font>. I live with my family during the summer in Brooklyn Park. <font color = "red" > My family includes my Dad (Peter), 
Mom
(Nancy), younger sister (Amelia), and younger brother (August). </font> <br/> <font color = "pink" size = "4" >When I left for my first year of college, I wasn't gone for two months before my parents agreed that my younger siblings could get a dog. So, I 
always
joke that my family replaced me with a dog- which of course is true!- that stole my middle name as her middle name. My dog's name is Maisy Mae and she is a German Short-Hair. I think that the only reason, my dad agreed to a dog was so that he could have a 
dog to
go peasant hunting with him. </font> <br/><font size = "5"> During the summers I work for the City of Brooklyn Park, Recreations and Parks as a Summer Camp
Counselor which I have beening working for about 6 summers now. I love working at the summer
camp, its a lot of fun and hard work but its an awesome seasonal job.</font><br/> I currently live off campus in a house with 3 other girls, one is a Nursing Major, another is a Clinical Lab Science Major, and the last one is a Cellular/Molecular Biology 
Major on
the Pre-dental Track. My
roommates are awesome, eventhough they can be a bit much at times.</p>
